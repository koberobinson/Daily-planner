# Daily-planner

## Overview
This assignment was given to us to help us understand more about time and localstorage in javascript. After this assignment I am more comfortable with how to use time inside of javascript

My motivation for this assignment was trying to better my self and using my time more wisely through the day.

I created this assignment because I am constantly finding my self putting things till the last minute so making a daily planner helps so much with that.

I learned more so about local storage and how to better use time inside of javascript.

## Installation
Installation is very easy. To type inside of the timeblocks just click the individual block and then to save click the blue button on the right hand side.
